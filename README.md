# War-Heroes-Remembered

Based on my original [War Heroes Remembered](AndrewH1188/war-heroes-remembered-ms2) project that I produced for my second Milestone Project with Code Institute, I have decided that it is time to expand and develop this great project further, whilst keeping the respectful presence that this site has. 




## Showcase
![responsive-screenshot](assets/images/testing/whr-responsiveness.jpg)


My original Code Institute War Heroes Remembered Milestone 2 website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/) and my newly developed site can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/War-Heroes-Remembered/). 

Although visually there maybe slight differences between the two, the main difference is in code base. Using SCSS that is compiled down to CSS is a start with the nesting and also separating stylesheets so that elements are easier to work with.

There is also the notable addition of the World War Two page which is featured from the Heroes dropdown in the navigation bar. 
There are further additions to make items such as the show more/less button function on the page as originally intended.

#### Strategy
Having completed this original website as my second milestone project with Code Institute and identifying improvements along the way, I have revisited this special website in order to make minor updates. Since my original milestone project where I had 4 pages and two items on each, I have split items like the Map onto its own page, as well as added a page for World War Two Heroes. The original fonts and colours have been kept as these are the "brand's" signature. Original images have been kept, but have been made smaller in height so a user isn't scrolling further to get past an image. There have been additional images that have been used on the WWII Heroes page, in the way of a header image and the heroes themselves.

## Design







## Imagery
* I designed the Favicon in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) then exported this as a jpg in order to add this into the images folder without any issues. I created the Favicon as a larger size than the usual that is required as this makes the resolution when displayed in the browser view higher resolution than the normal favicon size which appears pixilated. 
* The great image used as the Hero image on the home page had to change from the one on my initial design because I couldn’t find where I originally downloaded this from, so couldn’t credit the person that took this photograph. I found the new and very similar image on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) that I am able to credit.
1. [Poppies on the remembrance wall](https://stock.adobe.com/images/poppies-on-the-remembrance-wall/231816455?asset_id=231816455)
 * file #: 231816455
 * Photo uploaded to Adobe Stock by Vince
I selected this as the Hero image for the Home page (index.html) as it is a strong, complementary, respectful image to use as the remembrance wall has many poppies in to the fallen heroes. This image is complemented by the choice of colours that I have used.
2. [Graveyard with monument in Normandy](https://pixy.org/search.php?search=Graveyard+with+monument+in+Normandy)
This is the image that I have used on the home page (index.html) above the About Us (index.htm#aboutl) section. I have used this image to section off the about us section and also as it is in keeping with the theme of the site and what this is about which is remembering as well as learning about our War Heroes.

### Existing features




### Future features














## Technologies and Languages Used:







## Languages:
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 




## Libraries Frameworks and online resources:
* [Bootstrap 4.6.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
 Bootstrap was used to help set the navigation bar.
* Google Chrome Dev Tools: For testing purposes and to see why elements are not working as expected. Dev tools allowed me to make changes to my code in the browser to see a live representation of the website with the changes / amends that have been made.
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse): Was used for testing website performance, check for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I have tested as before on my Go Tennis System the different categories mentioned above on both mobile applications and computer applications and have loaded the screenshots of the results in the testing section.
* [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) Google Fonts was used to find a suitable font as well as to import this font into my website. The font that I decided to use as it was clean, stylish and fitting is called Poppins which is displayed on all pages on my website / throughout the project. This is to keep styles consistent throughout my website. 
* [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/) I have used fewer icons this time as I didn’t think that too many were appropriate given the subject of the site. The Font Awesome Icons that I have used have been listed below:
    * [Hamburger Bars icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/bars?style=solid)
    * [Facebook icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/facebook-f?style=brands)
    * [Twitter icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/twitter?style=brands)
    * [Instagram icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/instagram?style=brands)
    * [YouTube icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/youtube?style=brands)
    * [Arrow Up icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/arrow-up?style=solid)
    * [Send icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/paper-plane?style=regular)
* [W3C HTML-validator:](https://validator.w3.org/) used to find errors in my HTML code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [Jigsaw:](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to find errors in my CSS code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) for my JavaScript to see if there are any errors and use the feedback to fix these.
* [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) Again my friend Tiny PNG was used to compress the file size of all images without losing any of the original image quality or distorting the images in any way. This is so that when the pages are loaded the images do not slow down the loading speed and therefore make this user-friendly, as well as reduces the bounce rate of users viewing and clicking off the pages.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) I used the Google Maps API in order to add a map to my contact page with the markers and clusters in the areas that required these.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) I used EmailJS in order to hook up my contact section to my email in order to receive feedback, questions or submissions from the viewers that have interacted with my site.
* [Material Design for Bootstrap MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com/) was used for [scroll back to top](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/back-to-top/) to enable the user to effortlessly scroll back up to the top of the page without having to do this the long way.

## Tools:
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write my code as well as paste in code from Bootstrap. In GitPod I was also able to amend the code from Bootstrap as well as create and style code in both HTML and CSS. I was able to add images to the folders that I created, as well as files to contain the code. In GitPod I was also able to (using python3 -m http.server) view my web page in the browser in a separate tab, allowing me to use the inspect section in Google to inspect elements and see what worked, as well as what didn’t work and amend this accordingly.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Git was used for version control having set up the GitPod Terminal to commit and push saved changes and commits to GitHub.
* [GitHub:](https://github.com/) GitHub was used to store the saved changes from my project after being pushed from Git.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)was used to deploy my website and make this live for all to explore and use.
* [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the initial [wireframes](assets/images/designs/wireframes) and amend them to reflect the new feature(s).

## Programmes:
* [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html) Adobe InDesign was used to create the original design mock up of the site using colours, images, setting the text and layout. I did not recreate this site again in InDesign as I adapted and adjusted what I already had.
* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) Adobe Illustrator was used to create the poppy favicon and export this to a jpg so that this could be loaded into GitPod and display in the tab next to the War Heroes Remembered document name.
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) Adobe Photoshop was used to scale the Hero images as well as the photos of the Heroes, or ones that were used if the Heroes didn’t have a photo of the Hero.

## Other Resources:
* [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for any HTML errors and use the feedback to resolve / fix these. 
* [W3 Css Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any CSS errors and use the feedback to resolve /fix these. 
* [Ahmad Awais](https://codepen.io/ahmadawais/pen/NQdWQx?editors=1010) I used this to look and see how they managed to lay out the markers with the location names. I used their style for the var locations and did the same for mine. When the Marker is clicked the Hero location and name will show.  
* [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used for the screenshot of the mock up which is at the top in my README.md file and also to show off my site my different social media platforms. 
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used to test sizes, check responsiveness and view the layouts as well as debug errors and problems I encountered along the way.
* [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) was used to make my CSS look neat, tidy and easier to follow / read.
* [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/grammar-check) was used to check grammar, spelling, punctuation.
* [Onlinespellcheck.com](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) I have run my README.md through here to check for any spelling or grammar errors.


### Social Media:
* I already have the [Facebook](https://en-gb.facebook.com/) called [War Heroes Remembered](https://www.facebook.com/groups/911836479678983/) that I set up for my original War Heroes Remembered Milestone 2 Project.
* Again I have used my already set up [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) and have reused my [war_heroes_remembered](https://www.instagram.com/war_heroes_remembered/) account that was set up when I did my original War Heroes Remembered Milestone 2 Project.
* I set up a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) group for [War Heroes Remembered](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9515741) as a new way of posting content and reaching people further.
* A [Threads](https://www.threads.net) account was set up for [war_heroes_remembered](https://www.threads.net/@war_heroes_remembered) which is linked to my War Heroes Remembered Instagram account. I have removed twitter as Threads is the same, and I only require one and not both.

## Content:
I have written the content for the welcome, about and the contact page as well as the headings/titles for the articles that follow.
Due to the nature of the site I have had to rely on external sources to find names, dates, images and other contributing factors for each of the War Heroes on the Heroes pages.
The following outlines and shows the information that was gathered to complete the task for each Hero as well as the links that this information came from, be it partially or fully and have been listed in order as they appear on the page:

I used many online sources that I found in order to give as much information about those that I am including on my website, but not only this but to also confirm that the information that I obtained is as up to date and as correct as possible. I have checked through all links and these all link to the correct sources of the information I am looking for.

#### Memorial Location coordinates:
All of the coordinates that I have added to my JavaScript Map file have been found using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/). The name of the memorial or cemetery was searched for in the search box of Google Maps. In order to get the coordinates of the locations, I right-clicked the pin on the cemetery or memorial and this showed me at the top the coordinates for these. I listed the name, link and coordinates in a [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) file and then loaded the coordinates and names into the locations of my JavaScript Map file. I have made this easier for myself by adding the names of the memorials or cemeteries as commented out text above the latitude and longitude coordinates to remind me as well as make this clear to another developer should they wish to fork or clone my website.

* All images have been given credit in this document (my README file) in the Imagery section as well as their links and file numbers to find and download these for yourself. I have also added in as a comment where necessary the Imperial War Museums credit as requested.

* I have made every effort to attribute the work of others and credit them where possible. I would like to thank all the sources that are available for being able to not only find my relatives and the information but the relatives of others and information relating to them so their names may live forevermore and their sacrifices known.


## Acknowledgments 
A special thank you goes out to my superb Mum, she has once again had faith in me and encouraged me to redo this very special and important project, she has also guided me with constructive feedback with a tough image decision.

Another returning thank you goes out to Jim Jenner and his wife Susie Jenner for all their encouragement, support and interest even though they don’t understand what exactly it is that I do, but nevertheless are there for me and are proud of me.

Another recurring Thank you goes out to Stuart Crang at The Learning People Global. Stuart loved the first time I did this project, and I'm sure I have done this project justice enough for him to love it even more this time.

Another huge thank you goes out to all those who have shared the information about the War Heroes listed as this helped me to add text and images (where available) to each of those that played their part, with most cutting short their lives for us. Without the imput of others who shared this invaluable information I wouldn’t have had anything to be able to work with, so thank you again.

But of course last but not least a huge thank you also goes out to all those that served to give us our freedom and democracy. I just wish I could add all of you to this site as you all deserve to be included on this updated version two (which has now expanded into World War Two). You’re all heroes and thank you all for the sacrifices you have made so we can have our tomorrow, because you gave your today. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them.
