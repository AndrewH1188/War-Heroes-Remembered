# War-Heroes-Remembered

Based on my original [War Heroes Remembered](AndrewH1188/war-heroes-remembered-ms2) project that I produced for my second Milestone Project with Code Institute, I have decided that it is time to expand and develop this great project further, whilst keeping the respectful presence that this site has. 

My original Code Institute War Heroes Remembered Milestone 2 website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/) and my newly developed site can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/War-Heroes-Remembered/). 

Although visually there maybe slight differences between the two, the main difference is in code base. Using SCSS that is compiled down to CSS is a start with the nesting and also separating stylesheets so that elements are easier to work with.

There is also the notable addition of the World War Two page which is featured from the Heroes dropdown in the navigation bar. 
There are further additions to make items such as the show more/less button function on the page as originally intended.

## Content:
I have written the content for the welcome, about and the contact page as well as the headings/titles for the articles that follow.
Due to the nature of the site I have had to rely on external sources to find names, dates, images and other contributing factors for each of the War Heroes on the Heroes pages.
The following outlines and shows the information that was gathered to complete the task for each Hero as well as the links that this information came from, be it partially or fully and have been listed in order as they appear on the page:

#### WWI Heroes page 1 text sources:

I used many online sources that I found in order to give as much information about those that I am including on my website, but not only this but to also confirm that the information that I obtained is as up to date and as correct as possible. I have checked through all links and these all link to the correct sources of the information I am looking for.

#### Memorial Location coordinates:
All of the coordinates that I have added to my JavaScript Map file have been found using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/). The name of the memorial or cemetery was searched for in the search box of Google Maps. In order to get the coordinates of the locations, I right-clicked the pin on the cemetery or memorial and this showed me at the top the coordinates for these. I listed the name, link and coordinates in a [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) file and then loaded the coordinates and names into the locations of my JavaScript Map file. I have made this easier for myself by adding the names of the memorials or cemeteries as commented out text above the latitude and longitude coordinates to remind me as well as make this clear to another developer should they wish to fork or clone my website.

* All images have been given credit in this document (my README file) in the Imagery section as well as their links and file numbers to find and download these for yourself. I have also added in as a comment where necessary the Imperial War Museums credit as requested.

* I have made every effort to attribute the work of others and credit them where possible. I would like to thank all the sources that are available for being able to not only find my relatives and the information but the relatives of others and information relating to them so their names may live forevermore and their sacrifices known.


## Acknowledgments 
A special thank you goes out to my superb Mum, she has once again had faith in me and encouraged me to redo this very special and important project, she has also guided me with constructive feedback with a tough image decision.

Another returning thank you goes out to Jim Jenner and his wife Susie Jenner for all their encouragement, support and interest even though they don’t understand what exactly it is that I do, but nevertheless are there for me and are proud of me.

Another recurring Thank you goes out to Stuart Crang at The Learning People Global. Stuart loved the first time I did this project, and I'm sure I have done this project justice enough for him to love it even more this time.

Another huge thank you goes out to all those who have shared the information about the War Heroes listed as this helped me to add text and images (where available) to each of those that played their part, with most cutting short their lives for us. Without the imput of others who shared this invaluable information I wouldn’t have had anything to be able to work with, so thank you again.

But of course last but not least a huge thank you also goes out to all those that served to give us our freedom and democracy. I just wish I could add all of you to this site as you all deserve to be included on this updated version two (which has now expanded into World War Two). You’re all heroes and thank you all for the sacrifices you have made so we can have our tomorrow, because you gave your today. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them.
