# War-Heroes-Remembered

Based on my original [War Heroes Remembered](AndrewH1188/war-heroes-remembered-ms2) project that I produced for my second Milestone Project with Code Institute, I have decided that it is time to expand and develop this great project further, whilst keeping the respectful presence that this site has. 

My original Code Institute War Heroes Remembered Milestone 2 website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/) and my newly developed site can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/War-Heroes-Remembered/). 

Although visually there maybe slight differences between the two, the main difference is in code base. Using SCSS that is compiled down to CSS is a start with the nesting and also separating stylesheets so that elements are easier to work with.

There is also the notable addition of the World War Two page which is featured from the Heroes dropdown in the navigation bar. 
There are further additions to make items such as the show more/less button function on the page as originally intended.
